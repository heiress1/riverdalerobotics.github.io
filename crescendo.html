      <h1> 2024 Season - FIRST Crescendo </h1>
      <p>
        Showing off artistic talents, robots intake foam rings and shoot them into a speaker or amp to gain points!
        With notes flying across the field and robots hanging on chained stages, Crescendo is a game of musical mayhem!

          <h2> Acce-<i>LE</i>-rando </h2>
          <p>
            Named after our former mentor Nhat Le, and the musical term for increasing the speed of a piece,  
            Acce-<i>LE</i>-rando is a fitting name for our robot. With its incredibly light weight and swerve drive, our
            robot zips around the field, intaking game pieces and shooting them into the speaker with a 2-in-1 intake.
            Using pre-determined angles, the arm can be set to specific positions to score in both the speaker and amp.
            With the help of limelight, our robot can detect game pieces, and automatically drive over to it with the push
            of a button.
