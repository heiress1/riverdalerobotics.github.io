            <h2>Tech Rascals</h2>
            <p>
              The Tech Rascals made use of a mechanum drive robot, with a single claw design. The arm of the robot could rotate 360
              degrees, allowing it to place game pieces on the board from both the front, and the back. With the help of tensorflow, the bot used
              vision to detect team props in the autonomous period, and place game pieces down for extra points.

          <h2>Tech Racers</h2>
          <p>
            The Tech Racers made a fully 3D printed robot! With a black-pink colour scheme, this robot made use of its light weight to
            zip around the field. Using tank drive, the robot could push the game pieces into the scoring zone for points. It made use of
            tensorflow to detect team props in the autonomous period, and push game pieces to the correct area.

          <p>
            Made by the Riverdale 12th grade robotics class, this bot made use of mechanum drive to strafe around the field. It had a 2 claw
            intake, allowing it to pick up 2 game pieces at a time and score them on the board. Making use of tensorflow, this bot could detect
            team props in the autonomous period, and place a piece in the marked area. It could then score another note on the game board for an
            incredible 45 point auto!
