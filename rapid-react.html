          <h2> E-<i>Le</i>-vator </h2>
          <p>
            Named after our hard working lead mentor, Nhat Le, E-<i>LE</i>-vator was our
            tallest robot to date and brought us far in the competition.
            This year we experimented with a new drive terrain : a West coast drive
            with pneumatic shifters and worked heavily with chains and gears
            to produce two elegantly made elevators on each end of our robot.
            One was for climbing, the other for power cubes. Our skills have
            definitely grown and our robot was successful on reaching the tipped
            scale and switch, placing cubes in the vault and climbing
            alone and with other bots on the platform to face the boss!
