				<h2> First robotics competitions </h2>
				<p> 
					On the first Saturday of every year, <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org"> FIRST </a> releases a challenge to all FRC teams
				 	based on a specific theme. After that, teams have six weeks to design, build and program 
				 	their robot to be able to complete the tasks in the challenge. Later, the teams compete 
				 	against one another in alliances - groups of 3 teams - in competitions. In our 2018 season, we attended the Ryerson Regional, 
			 		North Bay Regional and were fortunate enough to make it to District Championships in Mississauga.
				</p>
				
				<h2>The "Le" Story</h2>
		        	<p> Our robots are named after our founding and hardworking mentor, Nhat Le.</p>

				    <h3>E<i>LE</i>vator</h3>
				    <p>
				    	Our tallest robot yet, ELEvator was brought us far in the competition. This year we experimented with a new drive
				    	terrain : a West coast drive with pneumatic shifters and worked with heavily with chains and gears to produce two elegantly
				    	made elevators on each end of our robot. One was for climbing, the other for power cubes. Our skills have definitely grown
				    	and our robot was successful on reaching the tipped scale and switch, placing cubes in the vault and climbing (and 
				    	climbing with other bots) on the platform to face the boss!

				    <h3>Optimus-Le</h3>
				    <p>
				    	Our team lacked resources such as a dedicated building space and we were low on funds, most of our designs were budget-efficient and simple. Originally, we wanted to incorporate a high goal shooting mechanism and did make many prototypes but ultimately found it difficult to integrate it into our robot design, so opted for a low-goal mechanism instead. Another huge aspect of our robot is its ability to climb a rope effectively, the design for this system consists of a velcro-attaching process. A motor was mounted onto the back of the robot with velcro wrapped around its axis and the rope we used also had velcro sewed onto the bottom so that the rope would attach to the motor easily and quickly.

					<h3>Tes-Le</h3>
					<p> 
						After world championships, the team continued to improve the shooter mechanism. 
						Originally, the shooter could only score low goal. The final version of Tes-Le 
						was created for both scores and was played in our last off season event at Victoria Park.
