            <h2>CharLEs-Augustin</h2>
            <p>
              CharLEs-Augustin was named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, the scientist for which the unit of
              charge was named after, and our beloved mentor, Nhat Le. The team decided that it was the perfect name since the name of the competition
              that year was Charged Up. It was also the team's first year using swerve drive. The robot had a
              pivot point for an arm and a pneumatically controlled claw to pick up and score game pieces.
              To control the arm, we used PID control. For autonomous mode, we used odometry to make the robot
              drive a pre-defined path that allowed us to exit the community and retrieve a cone. This allowed us to gain an early advantage to help us succeed.
