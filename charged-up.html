            <h2>FRC Newmarket Competition 2023</h2>
            <p>
            On March 5 and 6, R3P2 participated in the 2023 Newmarket Charged Up 
            event. Despite challenges with the robot, we were able to persevere, and 
            end in the top 20 teams after the qualification stage. With assistance 
            from our scouting team, which worked tirelessly to provide accurate data, 
            we were able to prepare for the alliance selection effectively. We ended 
            up in the top 15 of all teams at the tournament, being knocked out after 
            a hard fought lower bracket run.
