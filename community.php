						<h3> Fundraiser: Care for the Caribbean </h3>
						<p>
							In the summer of 2017, 3 disastrous hurricanes hit southern North America,
							2 of which immensely affected many islands in the Caribbean. Most of these
							countries almost completely destroyed and students and children were not able
							to attend school until much later in the year. Our fundraiser, Care for the
							Caribbean intends to raise money for this cause and in turn provide students
							with school supplies, and other technology assests to help them succeed and 
							learn.

				<h3> Inspiring The Female Engineers of Tomorrow </h3>
				<p>
					In mid-November, a group of female members on our team gave a presentation to a 
					<a href="https://www.girlguides.ca/web/">Girl Guides of Canada </a> club about females in STEM and 
					Robotics, hoping to give them an introduction to the opportunities that they could have 
					in Science and Engineering in high school.
