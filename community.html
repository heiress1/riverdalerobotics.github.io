        Our team is continuously trying to incorporate our community in our

          <h2> Caring for the Carribean </h2>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2017, 3 disastrous hurricanes hit southern North
            America, 2 of which immensely affected many islands in the Caribbean.
            Most of these countries almost completely destroyed and students and
            children were not able to attend school until much later in the year.
            Our fundraiser, Care for the Caribbean intends to raise money for
            this cause and in turn provide students with school supplies, and
            other technology assests to help them succeed and learn.

          <p>
            In mid-November, a group of female members on our team gave a
            presentation to a Girl Guides of Canada club about females
            in STEM and Robotics, hoping to give them an introduction to the
            opportunities that they could have in Science and Engineering in high school.
