      <h1> 2020 Season - FIRST Infinite Recharge: Powered by Star Wars </h1>
      <p>
        Riverdale Robotics had an amazing time designing and building our robot despite the
        cancellation of the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Infinite Recharge was a
        space themed game where robots had to shoot power cells into
        powers port and turn on a shield generator to prevent a shower of asteroids from
        destroying FIRST City!

          <h2> <i>Le</i> - Becca </h2>
          <p>
            <i>Le</i>-Becca named after the Star Wars character, <i>Chewbecca</i>, and our lead mentor,
            Nhat Le, is R3P2's 5th robot.There were three main functions to our robot that helped us
            succeed in the competitions. First off, we had our driving/steering system. For this, we
            coded the robot to use “tank steering”, and used rubber wheels so that our robot had good
            traction. We had two parts to the robot that helped us with the main objective. We had our
            ball launcher/deployer that would launch the balls into the open cargo slots, as well as a
            pneumatic hand that would place disks on both the shuttles, so that the cargo would stay in
            the container and we could earn points. Lastly, our robot had an elevator system that helped
            us climb up the final steps of the game. For this, we used wheels attached to a vertical metal
            bar that would elevate the robot vertically in order to climb up the two blocks.
