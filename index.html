          <h2> Let's Go Raiders! </h2>
          <p>
            The hum and buzz can be heard once again from robotics headquarters
            at Riverdale. Veterans and rookies alike arrived to room 101 on October 3rd
            for the first official team meeting of R3P2 of the 2019-2020 season.
            With a team of over 60 members, we have once again broken our team size
            record. Training, practice and experimentation are all tasks that our
            subteams will be undertaking over the next few months before kickoff on
            January 4th.

          <p>
            After hard work from the R3P2 executive team, the 2nd annual robotics
            fair has now wrapped up. We have furthered our team's presence in the school
            community and introduced many grade 9s to the wonder that is the FIRST
            Robotics Competition. We hope to have many students who were involved in the event
            at lunch apply to join the team. This was a great start to the school year
            and we are excited to get back to Robotics after the summer break!

          <h2> Ontario District Championships </h2>
          <p>
            From April 10th to 13th, R3P2 had the privelage of competing at the Ontario
            District Championships alongside some of the best teams in the world.
            We worked hard to qualify throughout the season and were proud to seed
            16th out of the 40 teams in the Science division. We also won the championship
            entrepreneurship award, an amazing feat. Our team finished the competition
            ranking 57 in the district out of a total of 179 teams! Sadly, this was
            not enough to qualify for the World Championships in Detroit and as such,
            this brings an end to the 2019 season for R3P2. We'd like to thank all
            our sponsors and we hope to see everyone back for next year's season.

            On April 5th, R3P2 packed it's bags and travelled to London, Ontario
            to compete in the Western Engineering Distrct Event at Western University.
            The weekend treated us well and at the end of the qualification rounds,
            5834 seeded at 11th out of 40 teams! In alliance selection, 5408 graciously invited
            us to join the fifth alliance alongisde 5596 to face the fourth alliance in playoffs.
            After a hard fought quarterfinals with a scoring tie and a tiebreaker match,
            we were sadly eliminated. However with our impressive run at this event,
            we racked up enough points to qualify for the Ontario District Championships
            taking place next weekend. We can't wait to see you all there!
