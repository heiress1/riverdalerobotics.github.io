          <h1> North Bay District Event </h1>
          <p>
            From March 29th to the 31st, R3P2 participated in the North Bay
            Regional at Nipissing University. Placing 24th after Qualification
            Matches and a few challenges in the way, we were chosen by our alliance
            captain Lake Effect Robotics and W.A.F.F.L.E.S Robotics in the second
            alliance and worked hard together to advance to finals ! We had an
            amazing time working and playing with them and can say that this
            competition has been one of the best performances by our team yet.
