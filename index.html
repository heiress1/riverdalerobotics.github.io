          <h2> Ontario District Comptetion </h2>
          <p>
            On April 12th to April 14th, our team gained enough points to
            attend the Ontario District Competition at the Hershey Centre in
            Missisauga, Ontario. After two days of competing, our team finished
            23rd from the qualifying rounds. Unfortunately, we were not picked
            during alliance selection but are very proud of our performance
            during the entire competition. Sadly, our power up season ends here
            but the amazing experiences, lessons and support we have received
            from other teams and our sponsors has been worth the journey. Thank
            you to everyone who took it with us and hope to see you in 2019!

          <h2> North Bay District Event </h2>
          <p>
            From March 29th to the 31st, R3P2 participated in the North Bay
            Regional at Nipissing University. Placing 24th after Qualification
            Matches and a few challenges in the way, we were chosen by our alliance
            captain Lake Effect Robotics and W.A.F.F.L.E.S Robotics in the second
            alliance and worked hard together to advance to finals ! We had an
            amazing time working and playing with them and can say that this
            competition has been one of the best performances by our team yet.

            From March 15 to March 17, we competed at the Ryerson University
            District event in downtown Toronto at the Mattamy Centre. We placed
            12th out of 37 teams in the qualification matches and were picked
            as a member on the 4th alliance. After two competitive quarter final
            matches, we were sadly eliminated.
