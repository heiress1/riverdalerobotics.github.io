        We are a student-lead high school robotics team that focuses on giving
        students the experiences and skills they need to navigate the STEM industry.
        Students are exposed to the dynamics of running a small business and gain
        valuable teamwork and leaderships skills from their experiences.

          <p>
            Congratulations to the robotics team for their strong effort at the STEMley Cup/Overtime Sunday tournament in Hamilton, on October 30th.
            We entered two teams out of 21 teams at the competition.
            Team A, was captain of the 6th alliance and was eliminated in the quarter final (Drivers: Sofia Pereira, Emelie Gordon).
            Team B was selected by the 1st alliance and went on to win the tournament (Drivers: Nathan Hudson, Joshua Liang).
            Thank you Ms. Nishio and Mr. Le for your support.

          <p>
            Our robotics team doesn't just focus on building robots but also a better world.
            Due to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, we started the 1000 Cranes for Ukraine 
            initiative. We asked the student body at RCI to donate money to help UNICEF in their 
            peacekeeping initiatives. For every $2 donated by a student, an origami paper crane was 
            hung in their honor with a message for peace.

            We collaborated with the social justice club and our student council to have a toiletry drive for
            the Riverdale Housing Action Group (RHAG). The RHAG aims to help our community with housing and
            our team wanted to participate in this change. We engaged the student body and got them to donate
            toothpaste, deodorant, and other toiletries to help patrons at the RHAG. We also managed to spread
            holiday joy by making cards and preparing gifts for the organization. We are grateful to work with
            such an amazing group. R3P2 is proud of the participation of our students to make a difference in their communities.

            for the first official team meeting of R3P2 of the 2019-2020 season.
            With a team of over 60 members, we have once again broken our team size
            record. Training, practice and experimentation are all tasks that our
            subteams will be undertaking over the next few months before kickoff on

            After hard work from the R3P2 executive team, the 2nd annual robotics
            fair has now wrapped up. We have furthered our team's presence in the school
            community and introduced many grade 9s to the wonder that is the FIRST
            Robotics Competition. We hope to have many students who were involved in the event
            at lunch apply to join the team. This was a great start to the school year
            and we are excited to get back to Robotics after the summer break!

          <h2> Ontario District Championships </h2>
          <p>
            From April 10th to 13th, R3P2 had the privelage of competing at the Ontario
            District Championships alongside some of the best teams in the world.
            We worked hard to qualify throughout the season and were proud to seed
            16th out of the 40 teams in the Science division. We also won the championship
            entrepreneurship award, an amazing feat. Our team finished the competition
            ranking 57 in the district out of a total of 179 teams! Sadly, this was
            not enough to qualify for the World Championships in Detroit and as such,
            this brings an end to the 2019 season for R3P2. We'd like to thank all
            our sponsors and we hope to see everyone back for next year's season.

            On April 5th, R3P2 packed it's bags and travelled to London, Ontario
            to compete in the Western Engineering Distrct Event at Western University.
            The weekend treated us well and at the end of the qualification rounds,
            5834 seeded at 11th out of 40 teams! In alliance selection, 5408 graciously invited
            us to join the fifth alliance alongisde 5596 to face the fourth alliance in playoffs.
            After a hard fought quarterfinals with a scoring tie and a tiebreaker match,
            we were sadly eliminated. However with our impressive run at this event,
            we racked up enough points to qualify for the Ontario District Championships
            taking place next weekend. We can't wait to see you all there!
