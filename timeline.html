            focused on programming and was also built during the Computer 
            Engineering Robotics course (TER4M). Our member from Build, 
            Kelvin, helped his team advance to the second round, and claim second place for the Innovative Award. Nathan,

            To increase awarness of FIRST and STEM at Riverdale, <!--the-->Riverdale <!--Raiders-->
            Robotics ran a new initiative: the Robotics Fair! This event allows all
            students to get a chance to get an inside peek into R3P2 and learn about
            all of our moving parts from Computer Aided Design to Sponsorship Relations.
            The students also get a chance to get to drive the robot and complete an
            obstacle course. The event was a huge success and we have already seen huge
            increases in interest during our recruitment.

          <p>
            On April 12th to April 14th, our team gained enough points to
            attend the Ontario District Competition at the Hershey Centre in
            Missisauga, Ontario. After two days of competing, our team finished
            23rd from the qualifying rounds. Unfortunately, we were not picked
            during alliance selection but are very proud of our performance
            during the entire competition. Sadly, our power up season ends here
            but the amazing experiences, lessons and support we have received
            from other teams and our sponsors has been worth the journey. Thank
            you to everyone who took it with us and hope to see you in 2019!

            captain Lake Effect Robotics and W.A.F.F.L.E.S Robotics in the second
            alliance and worked hard together to advance to finals ! We had an
            amazing time working and playing with them and can say that this
            competition has been one of the best performances by our team yet.

          <h2> Caring for the Carribean </h2>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2017, 3 disastrous hurricanes hit southern North
            America, 2 of which immensely affected many islands in the Caribbean.
            Most of these countries almost completely destroyed and students and
            children were not able to attend school until much later in the year.
            Our fundraiser, Care for the Caribbean intends to raise money for
            this cause and in turn provide students with school supplies, and
            other technology assests to help them succeed and learn.
