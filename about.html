                Aspiring future mechanical engineers who are in charge of the
                construction of the robot. Building their problem solving skills,
                they discuss strategies Devising several prototypes before our
                competition to maximize the efficiency and quality of the robot.

                Sub groups of the build team are Solidworks and 3D printing
                where they are currenty learning to create 3D models of the
                robot and give 3D Printing tutorials to the students of Riverdale
                Collegiate.

              <p>
                With problem solving and critical thinking skills, programmers
                write the instructions to control the pistons, pneumatics,
                and motors. The programmers code two modes for the robot,
                autonoumous and teleop. They continuously learn to code in Java,
                HTML and CSS. Our programming leads mentor students on the
                basics of robotics, web development and robot functionality.

                We also visit local businesses and nonprofit organizations to
                promote our team so that we can inform others of the purpose
                of our team, and inspire students around us to be involved with
                programs such as the FIRST Robotics Competition. Most importantly,
                we help our team gain the financial support needed to help maintain
                the team and continue giving opportunities for our students to
                grow their passion in STEM.
