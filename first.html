        <h1> What is FIRST? </h1>
        <p>
          FIRST is a non-profit organization that stands for <b>F</b>or <b>I</b>nspiration
          and <b>R</b>ecognition in <b>S</b>cience and <b>T</b>echnology. It tries to promote and
          encourage STEM education for students from kindergarden to grade 12.
          At the elementry and middle school level, FIRST has a program called
          <a href = "http://firstlegoleague.org/">
            FIRST Lego League (FLL)
          </a>
          where students build and program robots out of Lego.
          At the high school level, they have a program called
          <a href = "https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">
            FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)
          </a>
          which gives teenagers the experience of building,
          programming, modelling and designing a robot from scratch. R3P2 is an
          FRC team. Another remarkable program is
          <a href = "https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc">
            FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)
          </a>
          which enables a small group of middle and high school students in
          solving engineering problems. Each program is based on a challenge
          released by FIRST at the beginning of their season. After, teams have
          a specific amount of time to build, program and test their creations
          before attending competitions against other teams.

        <h1> FIRST Principles </h1>
        <p>
          FIRST aims to not only provide amazing experiences for students in
          STEM, but to also integrate and teach lessons that students will
          likely use in their futures when working on a project with a team.
          It's main principles are Gracious Professionalism and Co-opertition
          which means that members of all teams should act graciously and
          professionally with other members of FIRST as well as provide help
          and support to other teams when possible despite the fact that you may
          be competing against them. By doing this, the community in FIRST is
          built upon collaboration and kindness and hopes that students will
          take these important morals with them in their future endeavors.

        <h1> FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) </h1>
        <p>
          On the first Saturday of every year,
          <a href = "https://www.firstinspires.org/">
            FIRST
          </a>
          releases a challenge to all
          FRC teams based on a specific theme. After that, teams have six weeks
          to design, build and program their robot to be able to complete the
          tasks in the challenge. Later, the teams compete against one another
          in alliances - groups of 3 teams - in competitions. During competition
          season in Ontario, all teams must compete in 2 regional competitions.
          In these regional events teams gain points from how they place in
          qualification rounds and playoff matches. After, the highest achieving
          teams which have the most points are invited to go to Mississauga
          for the Ontario District Championships.In our 2018 season, we
          attended the Ryerson Regional, North Bay Regional and were fortunate
          enough to make it to District Championships in Mississauga.
